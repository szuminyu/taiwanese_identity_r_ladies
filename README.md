# Taiwanese Identity @ R Ladies NYC

I gave this short talk about Taiwanese identity at the lightening talk event held by R Ladies NYC. (June 2019)

Data is from Taiwan National Security Studies Surveys conducted by Duke University and National ChengChi University. You can find the data description and source here: https://sites.duke.edu/pass/

I mainly talked about two essential questions:
1. Taiwanese Identity: Taiwanese, Chinese, or Both
2. Independence or Unification

You can check out my slides for some interesting findings! Enjoy.
